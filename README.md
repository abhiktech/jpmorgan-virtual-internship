# JPMorgan Chase Software Engineering Virtual Internship Experience
As part of this internship, I worked on several projects revolving around the development of an alternative way to visualize and analyze share price data for traders and alert them of potential trading opportunities.

## Project 1 : Interface with a stock price data feed
In this task, I interfaced with relevant financial data feed and made the necessary adjustments to facilitate the monitoring of potential trade opportunities. I used `Python` to retreive stock data from a server, formatted that data, performed relevant calculations, displayed the computed values, and implemented unit testing.

## Project 2 : Implement the Perspective open source library in prepearation for data visualization
This task was an extension of the previous one where I integrated JP Morgan Chase's `Perspective` library to manipulate the previously computed data feeds and periodically update and display them visually using `React`.
